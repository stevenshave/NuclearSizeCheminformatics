Python programs starting with:

## 01_
Are used in generation of dictionaries stored in JSON objects, and populated by querying the ChEMBL webresource.

## 02_
Are used to profile the number of times a target was hit by NSR/NSW compounds.

## 03_
Are used to profile global NSR/NSW compounds active in all cell lines.

## 04_
Are used to profile nuclear size increasers and decreasers.
